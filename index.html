    <h1>Results Overview</h1>
    <p>
      This project extends the part of our A3 experiment where we evaluate how
      accurately perceive the median of the underlying dataset of a histogram.
      For this experiment, we have 5 different types of visualizations:
      histograms, density plots, scatter plots, beeswarm plots, and bar charts.
      The overarching goal of our experiment here was to determine how different
      graphs may impact users' ability to accurately find the median of the
      underlying dataset being visualized. It should be noted that for the sake
      of simplifying both our experiment and the task presented to users, if the
      elements of datasets we made both had x-coordinate values and y-coordinate
      values, the users only had to find the median of the x-coordinate values
      of the dataset.

    <h1>Results Summary</h1>
    <p>
      The table below shows the average error calculations for each of our
      visualizations. For all of the different charts, the original error metric
      calculated was the absolute difference between the true median
      x-coordinate value of the graphs' underlying dataset and the x-coordinate
      value of the graphs' underlying dataset that was selected by the user.
      However, we later found out that calculating the errors for each of our
      calculations this was was insufficient due to the range of the
      x-coordinate values of the graphs' underlying datasets being different. To
      address this issue, we normalized all of the obtained error calculations
      throughout our experiment by dividing all of them by the difference
      between the maximum and minimum x-coordinate values of their corresponding
      graphs' underlying datasets. Therefore, the final formula used for
      calculating the error calculations throughout the entire experiment was:

    />

    <p>
      Once all of the normalized error calculations were calculated, we then
      grouped them all by their corresponding vsiaulization. After doing so, we
      were able to calculate the average error for each visualization by summing
      up all their corresponding normalized errors and then dividing the total
      by the number of trials conducted for that particular visualization. The
      formula representing this calculation for each visualization is:

      <tr>
        <th>Visualization</th>
        <th>Error</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Histogram</td>
        <td>0.0359</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Density Plot</td>
        <td>0.0289</td>

        <td>Scatter Plot</td>
        <td>0.0732</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Bar Chart</td>
        <td>0.0528</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      An interesting reault that came out of these calculations are that despite
      its unique format, the bar chart visualization did not have the largest
      average error calculation. A possible reason why this is the case is the
      fact that we gave hints to the users in order to help them figure out how
      to interpret its data correctly.

    <h1>95% Confidence Intervals For Errors</h1>

    <p>From this image, as the bar chart and beeswarm plot confidence intervals do not overlap, then we can say that there is a statistically significant difference between the absolute errors between the bar chart task and the beeswarm plot task. Additionally, as the bar chart task gave us a wider confidence interval, it also suggests that there was a higher variance of errors for that task than the beeswarm task. Moreover, the fact that the bar chart task gave us a wider confidence interval than the beeswarm plot task also suggests that the bar chart task was the harder of the two tasks for users. Users tended to more drastically underestimate or overestimate the x-coordinate of the median for the bar chart task in comparison to the beeswarm plot task. As the bar chart and density plot confidence intervals do not overlap, then we can say that there is a statistically significant difference between the absolute errors between the bar chart task and the density plot task.
